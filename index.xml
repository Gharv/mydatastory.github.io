      <description>Many times getting started in any type of programing can be extremely difficult simply due to all the new terms being thrown at you. This is especially true for anyone who feels uncomfortable around computers in general. Here we are to talk about the basics of what getwd() and setwd().
The wd in these functions stands for ‘working directory’, for anyone who doesn’t know what a working directory is it is simply a folder that the program points to.</description>

      <description>XMag is the second Hugo theme I have designed. It is based on my first Hugo theme XMin, and similarly, features minimalism but with a magazine style on the homepage inspired by The Signpost on Wikipedia. You can find its source code on Github: https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmag (licensed under MIT).
Features This theme includes a few cool features:
 Responsive article summary blocks on homepage
 Thumbnails in summary blocks
 Magazine title in Blackletter (&amp;Bfr;&amp;Lfr;&amp;Afr;&amp;Cfr;&amp;Kfr; &amp;Lfr;&amp;Efr;&amp;Tfr;&amp;Tfr;&amp;Efr;&amp;Rfr;)</description>
